# JetsProject


# Description
The Jets Program  populates an array list from a text file of different types of jets. The array list is represented by a hangar or airfield class.
The user of the program is presented with a menu that allows them to view the list of jets in the airfield, call a fly method for all jets, view certain 
information about each jet, ask the jets that carry cargo to load it, ask the jets that fight to fight, as well as add/remove jets. The user can 
interact with these options as many times as they choose until they pick the option to quit. 

# Lessons Learned
The Jets project really stressed the importance of understanding the class relationships and the ability to pass, retrieve and manipulate information 
throughout the classes and their methods via inheritance and polymorphism. One of the major obstacles I faced early on in this program was, in fact,
trying to access class behavior through the application before having instanciating an object of that class. The menu objectives of 5 & 6 posed a 
challenge when using instanceof that was overcome by referencing the downcasting precedence so that the appropriate interface could be implemented.
